# 🐍 Neon-Themed Snake Game 🎮

### Because why should snakes only crawl when they can GLOW?

---

## 🔥 About the Project

This is my take on the classic Snake Game, but with a modern, neon arcade vibe and sound-packed gameplay — built entirely in **Java** using **Swing**.

---

## 🚀 Features

✅ Neon-themed snake, food, and obstacles  
✅ Dramatic sound effects (because quiet snakes are boring)  
✅ Countdown timer before the game starts  
✅ Hunger mechanic: eat before the snake "starves"  
✅ Obstacles change positions after every few food pickups  
✅ Start screen, pause/resume, and flashy game over animation  
✅ Wrapping screen edges (because boundaries are overrated)

## 🛠️ Built With

- Java (Swing GUI)
- Java Sound API
- OOP (because writing spaghetti code isn't cool)

## 🎯 How to Run the Game

1. **Compile** the source files:  
   ```bash
   javac GamePlay.java Main.java
````

2. **Run** the game:

   ```bash
   java Main
   ```

3. Alternatively, run the provided `.jar` file :

   ```bash
   java -jar SnakeGame.jar
   ```

⚡ **Note:** Make sure your `resources` folder with all images and audio files is present in the correct structure.

## 🎨 Resources

All images are inside the `resources` folder and sound effects and music are in the 'assets' folder .

## 🎥 Bonus

Video proof of glowing, pixel-munching fun available on my LinkedIn post! 😎

## 🤔 Why I Did This

* To learn GUI with Java
* To battle hunger — both in-game and in real life
* To fight with pixels & sound files for hours (and win)
